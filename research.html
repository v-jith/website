                        <p>A resource-constrained decision maker (DM) designs a continuous-time sequential
experiment to determine the best choice from an array of treatments. The DM
divides her attention between observing the treatments until one of the resources
runs out. Under the minimax regret criterion, we characterize the optimal sampling
strategy for two treatments in the following settings: (1) when there is a fixed array
of resources and (2) when there is a single resource (money) and the DM can stop
adaptively. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the typical optimal stopping
problem in which we model diffusions with respect to the cumulative resource
expenditure rather than the elapsed time.</p>

                        <p>We study a game of strategic interaction in which an experimenter designs a costly 
                            sequential experiment to maximize his utility subject to a welfare constraint imposed by a regulator. 
                            The experimenter chooses how to adaptively assign units across two treatments and when to stop the experiment. 
                            We characterize the optimal experiment design in a setting where outcomes are modeled by a Brownian motion and 
                            the agents share a Gaussian prior over the unknown drift of this process. 
                            We further show that this same design is asymptotically optimal in discrete time under parametric distributions of outcomes. 
                            The optimal assignment rule is the Neyman allocation after some fixed time. Furthermore, the experiment ends when the 
                            difference in posterior means exceeds one of a pair of asymmetric positive and negative thresholds that converge to 0 over time.</p>
