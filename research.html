        <p>
            A resource-constrained decision maker (DM) designs a continuous-time sequential
            experiment to determine the best choice from an array of treatments. The DM
            divides her attention between observing the treatments until one of the resources
            runs out. Under the minimax regret criterion, we characterize the optimal sampling
            strategy for two treatments in the following settings: (1) when there is a fixed array
            of resources and (2) when there is a single resource (money) and the DM can stop
            adaptively. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the typical optimal stopping
            problem in which we model diffusions with respect to the cumulative resource
            expenditure rather than the elapsed time.
